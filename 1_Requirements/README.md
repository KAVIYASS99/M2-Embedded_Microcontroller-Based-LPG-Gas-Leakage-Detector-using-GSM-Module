# INTRODUCTION

   The presence of dangerous LPG leakage in the cars, service station or in the storage tank environment can be detected using the Ideal Gas Sensor. This LPG gas leakage detector unit can be easily integrated into a unit that can sound an alarm or give a visual suggestion of the LPG concentration. The sensor has both admirable sensitivity and rapid response time. This sensor can also be used to sense other gases like iso-butane, propane, LNG and even cigarette smoke.
 
   The output of the sensor goes LOW as soon as the LPG sensor senses any gas leakage from the storage. This is detected by the microcontroller and the LED & buzzer is turned ON. After the delay of few milliseconds, the exhaust fan is also turned ON for throwing the gas out and it continues sending message as ‘GAS LEAKAGE’ to a mobile number which is pre-defined.
   
   MQ-5 semiconductor sensor is Combustible Gas Sensitive. The MQ-5 gas sensor is made up of SnO2 which has lower conductivity in clean air. A simple electro-circuit is used here which is used to convert the changing conductivity into corresponding output signal of gas concentration. Both Methane and Propane can be detected easily by MQ-5 sensor because it has high sensitivity towards Methane, Propane and Butane. It is a low cost sensor suitable for different application.
